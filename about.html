  <p>
Hi, I'm Ayaan, I was born in Canada and am currently in grade 8. When I was around
four my parents would let me use the computer with the little eraser mouse
and that is how I learned how to use a windows computer. I really started to get
into technology in grade 5 because my parents would ask me to help them with their computer
and I would google it and that's how I got into technology.
I started to learn how to program in grade six
by my cousin Ammar and thanks to him this website would not exist so let's all thank Ammar for
his great work.That is how I learned how to program, what about you?
